Enable proxy to github via `proxy http`.
GitHub cli `gh` has been well configured.

## Git Workflow Quality Gates

Before any `git commit` or `git push`, the following checks MUST pass at the repository root. Commands are defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json).

1. Type check must succeed
   - Run: `npm run typecheck`
   - Requirement: Exit code 0, no TypeScript errors

2. Formatting must be clean
   - Run: `npm run format:check`
   - If it fails, auto-fix with `npm run format`, re-stage changes, and re-run `format:check`

3. Linting must pass
   - Run: `npm run lint`
   - Requirement: Exit code 0, no ESLint errors or warnings
   - If it fails, try `npm run lint:fix`, re-stage changes, and re-run `lint`

4. App must build
   - Run: `npm run build`
   - Requirement: Exit code 0

Additional guidance:
- If lint fails, prefer `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix trivial issues, then re-stage and re-run checks.
- Do not commit artifacts in `dist/`, `out/`, `build/`, or `release/` (already ignored via [.gitignore](mdc:.gitignore)).
- Before any GitHub network operation (clone/fetch/pull/push), ensure local proxy is on: `proxy http`.

### One-shot check before committing

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run build
```

If any step fails, do not proceed with the commit or push. Fix the issues and re-run the checks.
